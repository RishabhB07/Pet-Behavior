              Hello, my name is Rishabh Banerjee.
              I study in Billabong High International School, Thane.
              I am a student of seventh grade.
              I am learning coding from Rakshanda Ma'am in WhiteHat Jr. and thoroughly enjoy my learning experience.
              My hobbies are coding, cubing, reading fictional books and playing Tabla (Indian Acoustic Drum).
              I am also a Black belt in Karate (a form of martial art).
              I enjoy cubing and adapted this hobby when I was 11 years old. At first it seemed a difficult capability but as I practised it became very easy.
              I have accomplished the feat of solving a 3x3 Rubiks Cube in just 18.51 seconds (my personal best).
              Everyone should try to learn how to solve a cube because it is an excellent mental exercise. 😃

              <p id="behavior">Because dogs sweat through the pads on their feet, most of their body heat is expelled through their mouth when they pant. It’s their primary means of regulating body temperature. Dogs also pant to cope with pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Dog Chewing</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Just as a growing child, your dog will want to chew on toys and other objects to relieve the pain of a new set of teeth coming in. If your dog is full grown, you may also come home to find your couch cushions or favorite pair of shoes ripped to shreds, but it is not because they enjoy the taste. Your dog could be exhibiting signs of separation anxiety or anxiety in general.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Dog Digging in Your Yard</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Digging is an instinctual activity, written deep in a dog’s DNA. It is especially strong in terrier breeds. Dogs in natural packs will dig to hide food or to uncover food such as small rodents. A den dug in the cool earth can also provide shelter from the heat.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Jumping Up</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Though it may seem like play behavior, or an enthusiastic greeting, jumping up is a sign that your dog is attempting to assert her dominance over you. By encouraging jumping up with affection, you are reinforcing the behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Dog Biting</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">A dog will bite a person as a way of communicating their current state of mind. The dog could be reacting in aggression, fear or nervousness. There are, however, ways to prevent a dog bite from ever happening if you stay in tune to the dog’s body language.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Separation anxiety</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Dogs live and travel in packs, so it’s natural for them to feel anxious when they are separated from their pack-mates. Try taking your dog on a nice, long walk before leaving her alone in the house. Leaving her in resting mode can calm her anxiety.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Cat Purring</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Most people consider purring to be a universal sign that a cat is happy and content. For the most part, cats will purr when they are comfortable and happy. Cats often purr when being pet, enjoying the sunshine or sitting on your laptop computer as you try to work. Purring, however, can also be a sign of stress due to unfamiliar situations or surroundings. It can also be when your cat is sick or injured. When a cat purrs, the vibrating cords in the larynx create vibrations across the cat’s entire body that can be soothing in a stressful situation. If your cat is purring excessively or in situations where purring is not common, it could be a sign of illness or injury. Thoroughly examine your cat or take them to a veterinarian especially if the cat is not eating, drinking or otherwise acting “normal.”</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Feline Grooming</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Cats also typically spend a great deal of time grooming. For some cats, grooming can take up to 50 percent of their time. Grooming helps cats stay tidy, but their saliva also helps insulate their bodies and keep them warm. So, you may see your cat grooming more in cold weather. Each cat will have different grooming habits and patterns, so pay attention to your cat’s beauty regime. If grooming is excessive (overall or in a certain area) or causes loss of fur, you should bring your cat to the veterinarian for an examination.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4 mt-lg-0" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="300">

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Damage from Your Cat’s Kneading</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Another common cat behavior is kneading. Cats are known to push their front paws in and out in a motion that resembles a baker kneading dough. In this case, however, the “dough” is a pillow, carpet, furniture or a person’s chest or head. Experts are not certain why cats behave this way. Some believe it is residual behavior from nursing as a kitten, or simply a way to show contentment. Other experts point out that cats have glands in the pads of their paws, so perhaps this behavior is a way to mark their territory. If kneading is causing damage, make sure to keep your cat’s nails trimmed. If your cat is kneading you and causing pain, simply distract the cat by petting, playing with the paws or giving a treat. Avoid scolding or punishing the cat for kneading because the behavior is instinctual.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Climbing on Everything</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Cats generally like high places and are excellent climbers. This behavior is genetic since cats are natural predators. A higher vantage point gives them a better view of their surroundings. Another practical reason for seeking a comfy ledge is to hide. Which can allow them to take advantage of the warmer air or settle down for a nice catnap without being disturbed. Interestingly, in a household of cats, the dominant cat usually occupies the highest perch. There are many types of cat perches that you can buy or make on your own, but make sure that the perch is safe and can hold the weight of your cat. If your cat enjoys climbing on high shelves or above the refrigerator and cabinets, make sure the area is clear of items that could hurt or trap your cat. And beware of falling objects.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="200">

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Destructive Cat Scratching</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Other cat behavior includes burying and scratching which is another instinct in all cats. Some cats will paw at the area around their food dish to mimic burying, as well as covering their tracks after using the litter box. Cats will naturally scratch to keep nails clean and to mark territory. Or course, cats may want to scratch furniture or walls, so make sure to provide more acceptable options like a scratching post. Cats prefer to scratch textures that are appealing, so you can discourage a cat from scratching certain areas by applying double-sided tape or aluminum foil. With a bit of patience, you can direct your cat to scratch acceptable objects and minimize unwanted scratches in the household.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="300">
            <div id="cat" class="icon-box">
              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Feline Curiosity</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Cats are also prone to curling up into a tight ball to sleep which provides warmth and security. A similar behavior is referred to as “loafing around” when cats curl their paws under to form a shape that looks like a little loaf of bread. This is done not only to look cute, but to regulate body heat and conserve warmth. Some cat behavior is simply the result of curiosity. While it may seem that cats are trying to type on the computer or enjoy pushing objects off a table or shelf, this behavior is common in many cats simply as a form of play. Also, cats probably enjoy watching the humans reacting to their mischievous antics. Again, pay attention to how your cat plays and take note if your cat’s behavior changes because there could be a medical reason for the change.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Preening</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Parrots preen continually throughout the day to keep their feathers clean and neat. Preening is never a problem until it becomes “over preening” and you notice that your parrot is actually chewing or plucking out feathers.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h4><a href="">Regurgitating</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Regurgitating is when an adult parrot brings up partially digested food to feed a mate or chicks. Parrots that are closely bonded to their humans will also regurgitate to their owner — a very sweet gesture, but quite unnecessary! If you want it to stop, you can thank the bird and then just casually walk away. Regurgitation is different from vomiting; a parrot that’s vomiting is ill, and the vomit will likely stick to the feathers around the face and chest — this parrot needs medical attention.</p>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Playing</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Yes, parrots actually play just like kids! Not all of their behavior is a function of biology. Parrots are intelligent creatures that will look for something to do rather than just sit around in a cage, so it’s important to have plenty of toys available.</p>
            </div>

              <h4><a href="">Cat Napping</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Parrots take catnaps throughout the day, which is completely normal, especially if the parrot naps on a perch while standing on one leg. If the parrot is standing on two legs with its feathers fluffed, he is either cold or possibly ill.</p>
            </div>

              <h4><a href="">Freezing In Place</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">A parrot that is afraid might freeze in place, not moving even a feather in hopes that he won’t be seen. This is because many predators’ eyes only pick up movement, so they have a hard time distinguishing inanimate objects.</p>
            </div>

              <h4><a href="">Hiding</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">A parrot that doesn’t want to be put back into the cage might hide at the back of the cage (on the outside) or find somewhere else to hide.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="300">

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Aggression</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Sometimes aggression is normal behavior. Some parrots get hormonal in the spring and may try to protect their cage. Others may not like a certain way of being handled, or are perhaps acting out of jealousy. Whatever the case, aggression always has a cause and can be quelled once the cause is discovered and handled appropriately.</p>
            </div>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Begging</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Some parrots revert to “baby” begging behavior to get what they want, especially if it has worked in the past. This includes getting into a crouched position, scrunching the wings up, bobbing the head and making chick noises. You can limit this behavior by not indulging it.</p>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Hiding</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Hiding is completely natural behavior for most fish, especially when they are first introduced to their new aquarium. Just make sure you keep your fish comfortable and healthy, and he should start coming out of hiding more readily.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4 mt-md-0" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="200">
            <div id="fish" class="icon-box">
              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Fighting</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your fish are fighting, it generally means that they are not a compatible fit to be housed in the same aquarium. Many fish are naturally aggressive and will defend their territory to the death. Before stocking your aquarium, you should do research on which types of fish are compatible with others together.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4 mt-lg-0" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="300">

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Swimming Erratically</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your fish is swimming erratically, he could just be playing or exercising. If your fish does it this consistently and seems unhealthy, the cause may be poor water quality. You should test your water for pH, ammonia, and nitrates immediately to see if anything is improper and harming your fish. If everything is in order, the cause of your fish’s erratic behavior may could be a parasite. If your fish is rubbing himself up against something in the tank, then swimming quickly away, he may have an external parasite.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-stretch mt-4" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Listlessness</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your fish seem tired and lethargic, it can be as a result of many factors. One common cause is improper water temperature. If your fish’s water is too hot or too cold, they will be very inactive. Check your heater and verify that your aquarium is at the right level. Other possible causes are overfeeding and improper water quality.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Sitting on the Bottom</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your fish is spending lots of time at the bottom of the tank, it may be normal behavior. Many fish, like catfish, are bottom-feeders and spend their time there. Fish also often sleep at the bottom of their tank. If your fish’s activity, however, does not seem to fit either of these reasons, and he looks tired and listless at the bottom of the tank, it may be a sign of disease. If you think this is the case, you should quarantine the fish. A common disease that would cause this behavior is a swim bladder infection, which is a result of a poor diet or water quality. Try fasting your fish for a day or two or feeding it easy-to-digest foods such as peas.</p>

              <div><i></i></div>
              <h4><a href="">Gasping for Air</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your fish look like they are gasping for air at the top of the aquarium, this is a sign that either your water quality is poor or there is not enough dissolved oxygen in the water. You should test your water and consider getting an aerator for your tank.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Hopping or Dancing</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Hopping or dancing is a sign of pure joy and happiness. The rabbit’s “dancing” can include leaping, doing a binky (jumping straight up and spinning in the air) and racing around.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h4><a href="">Grunting</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">If your rabbit grunts, it usually means she is angry – and possibly feels threatened. Sometimes, grunting is followed by a nip or bite. Some rabbits do not like it when you rearrange their cages as you clean; they may grunt, charge or even nip you when you try. They are creatures of habit and once they get things just right, they like them to remain that way.</p>

              <p id="behavior">When a rabbit stomps or thumps, this indicates that he or she is frightened, mad, or sensing danger (real or imagined).</p>

              <h4><a href="">Grinding Noise</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Rabbits may softly grind their teeth when they are content (such as when you’re petting them). Loud teeth grinding, however, can indicate that the rabbit is in pain or is ill. Take your rabbit to a rabbit veterinarian if you hear loud teeth grinding.</p>

              <h4><a href="">Playing</a></h4>
              <p id="behavior">Rabbits like to push or toss objects around. They may also race madly around the house, jump on and off the furniture, and act like children who have had too much sugar. Rabbits love toys and some will play for hours with a favorite toy.</p>
